# Analysis of ESP32-C6 Random Number Generator (Ent)

## 1. Frequency of Values:

Overall, the values seem fairly well distributed across the possible values, which is a good sign for a random number generator, but there is a slight dominance of certain values (notably 1 and 0).

## 2. Entropy:

Entropy = 3.555 bits per byte.

3.555 bits per byte is relatively low compared to the maximum entropy, indicating that the data is not perfectly random and exhibits some patterns or repetitive motifs.

## 3. Optimal Compression:

Compression is generally more efficient when data exhibits repetitive patterns or dependencies. This aligns with the relatively low entropy.

## 4. Chi-Square Test:

Chi-square = 43,310,009.41.  
The probability that a random sample exceeds this value is less than 0.01%.  
The fact that this value exceeds 99.99% of random values suggests that the data is not perfectly random, which is consistent with the entropy result.

## 5. Monte Carlo for Pi:

The Monte Carlo test for Pi involves using a random sample to estimate the value of Pi.  
A value of 4.0 (with an error of 27.32%) is far from the correct value of 3.14159...  
This indicates that the RNG values are not completely random.

## 6. Serial Correlation Coefficient:

A coefficient of -0.007 indicates that the values are very slightly correlated, but this correlation is extremely weak.

## Conclusion:

The random number generator (RNG) used seems quite good, but it shows some flaws, particularly a relatively low entropy (indicating some structure or repetitive patterns) and an average value lower than expected.
